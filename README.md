The Baremetrics date range picker is a simplified solution for selecting both date ranges and single dates all from a single calender view. There aren't a billion options but the code is pretty basic and modular so feel free to edit however to meet your own needs.

## Installing

Using the date picker is pretty simple, you've just got to make a couple choices and include a couple settings.
Create a div with a `daterange` class and then either the `daterange--double` or `daterange--single` classname for targeting the specific calendar you'd like to generate.

```html
<div class="daterange daterange--double"></div>
<div class="daterange daterange--single"></div>
```

Next you've just gotta create a `new Calendar` instance.

```js
new Calendar({
  element: $('.daterange--single'),
  current_date: 'June 15, 2015'
});

new Calendar({
  element: $('.daterange--double'),
  earliest_date: 'January 1, 2000',
  latest_date: new Date(),
  start_date: 'May 1, 2015',
  end_date: 'May 31, 2015',
  callback: function() {
    var start = moment(this.start_date).format('ll'),
        end = moment(this.end_date).format('ll');

    console.debug('Start Date: '+ start +'\nEnd Date: '+ end);
  }
});
```

## Developing

I've included my signature gulpfile too so be sure and take a look at that as well.

```bash
$ cd <project directory>
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

I also use [pow](http://pow.cx/) and the [powder gem](https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder) to run my local dev environments but however you plan on wrangling that the gulpfile turns on a livereload server so as long as you have the files serving somehow any changes you make will show up instantly.

## Dependencies
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
